# Why Visualisation

---

# Visual Data Analytics (VDA)

- The entire process leading to data graphing. 
--

- Encompasses the preparation of data for graphing and exploratory data analysis methods.
--

- Not simply about making ‘pretty pictures’ but about comprehending features of the data that are otherwise hidden by summary statistics.
--

- VDA is an invaluable business intelligence tool that uncovers hidden opportunities, and informs clear decision making

---

# How is VDA used?

- To report data using visual means rather than tables, enabling faster comparisons.
--

- For exploratory analysis to uncover new questions, 
--
discover previously unknown patterns, 
--
identify extreme behaviour and 
--
understand relationships between variables.
--

- As a diagnostic tool following statistical estimation.

---

# Why do we visualise?

-   More than 50% of the brain's neurons dedicated to vision.
--

-   Nearly 10 million bits of information are processed per second through our eyes.
--

-   Pre-attentive processing decodes information with high accuracy within 250 milliseconds (Healy and Enns, 2012).
--

-   We have evolved to better decode information through visualisation.

---

# Example

-   Consider data on number of trips made for the purpose of holidays in two Australian regions:
--

  -   Alice Springs in the Northern Territory,
  -   The Wilderness West in Tasmania.
--

-   We will look at these data in two different ways.
--

- May want to understand how demand evolves over the year to plan resourcing.

---

# As raw data

```{python}
import pandas as pd
dat = pd.read_csv('../data/tourism.csv')
```

`r kableExtra::kable_styling(knitr::kable(py$dat,digits=2),bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 16)`
---

  

# As a plot (Alice Springs)

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
datt = dat
datt['Quarter']=pd.to_datetime(datt['Quarter'])
datp = dat.to_markdown()
fig, ax, = plt.subplots(figsize = (25,18))
plt.plot(datt['Quarter'],datt['Alice Springs'],linewidth=5)
plt.ylabel('Alice Springs', fontweight='bold',fontsize='25')
plt.xlabel('Date', fontweight='bold',fontsize='25')
ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(labelsize=24)
ax.yaxis.set_tick_params(labelsize=24)
plt.show()
```

---

# As a plot (Wilderness West)

```{python}
fig, ax, = plt.subplots(figsize = (25,18))
plt.plot(datt['Quarter'],datt['Wilderness West'],linewidth=5)
plt.xlabel('Date', fontweight='bold',fontsize='25')
plt.ylabel('Wilderness West', fontweight='bold',fontsize='25')
ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(labelsize=24)
ax.yaxis.set_tick_params(labelsize=24)
plt.show()

```

---

# As a plot (Both)

```{python}
fig, ax, = plt.subplots(figsize = (25,18))
plt.scatter(datt['Alice Springs'],datt['Wilderness West'],s=100)
plt.xlabel('Alice Springs', fontweight='bold',fontsize='25')
plt.ylabel('Wilderness West', fontweight='bold',fontsize='25')
ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(labelsize=24)
ax.yaxis.set_tick_params(labelsize=24)
plt.show()

```


---

# Insights 

- Both time series have a seasonal pattern.
  - There are some times of the years more popular for holidays.
--

- The seasonal patterns are different.
  - Alice Springs and Tasmanian Wllderness have very different climate.
--

- It is easier to make these insights by visualisation rather than looking at raw numbers.

---

# Anscombe's Quartet

- Anscombe's quartet is a synthetic dataset of pairs of variables.
--

- For each data set, the means and variances and correlation between $x$ and $y$ are the same.
--

- However a simple scatterplot shows how different the datasets are:

---

# Anscombe's Quartet

```{python}
aq = pd.read_csv('../data/anscombe.csv')
fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=2,ncols=2,figsize = (25,18))
ax[0,0].scatter(aq['x1'],aq['y1'],s=100)
ax[0,1].scatter(aq['x2'],aq['y2'],s=100)
ax[1,0].scatter(aq['x3'],aq['y3'],s=100)
ax[1,1].scatter(aq['x4'],aq['y4'],s=100)
plt.show()

```

# The good, the bad and the ugly

---

# Tufte's Principles

- Principles of good practice in data visualisation are outlined in *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* by Edward Tufte. These include:
--

  - Avoid distorting what the data have to say,
  - Present many numbers in a small space,
  - Make large data sets coherent,
  - Encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data.


---

# Iliinsky's four pillars

A visualisation is not just a picture

- Purpose (the why): have clear focus.
- Content (the what): contain correct and useful information.
- Structure (the how): what graph to choose.
- Formatting (everything else): bring focus.

For more see the video [here](https://methods.sagepub.com/video/four-pillars-of-effective-visualization-design#:~:text=Noah%20Iliinsky%20discusses%20the%20four,and%20design%20types%20to%20avoid.)

# Bad plots

- Plots may be bad due to:
  - Poor taste,
  - Perceptually misleading,
  - Data issues.
--

- In the following examples, also think about whether or not there are issues with: 
  - How the data is *encoded* into a visualisation, i.e. data $\rightarrow$ visuals,
  - How the data are *decoded* by the person interpreting the plot , i.e. visuals $\rightarrow$ insight.


---

# Poor taste

![Monstrous costs](img/monster.jpg)

---

# Chartjunk

- Chartjunk is the inclusion of elements that are not necessary to communicate the information.
--

- The inclusion of the following can be considered chartjunk:
  - Heavy gridlines,
  - Unnecessary text,
  - Pictures within the chart.
--

- These are not incorrect but can be misleading due to a lack of objectivity.
--

- Also examples of chartjunk that do not mislead.


---

# Data-ink ratio

![LowDI](img/Chartjunk-example.svg)

---

# Data-ink ratio

- One way to think about the design of a visualisation is using the *data-ink* ratio.
--

- The idea is to show the most data with the least amount of 'ink'.
--

- In the previous plot, the stripes on the bars, the color in the background do not convey any information about the data.
--

- This is an example of chatjunk that is not misleading.
---

# Data density

![](img/sword.jpg)

---

# Data density

- In the previous plot there is only one data point.
--

- Visualisation is not misleading.
--

- However is a visualisation necessary here?
--

- Visualisations that convey more data are said to have a high *data density*.
--

- In general, try to avoid low data density.

---

# Perceptually misleading

- Human perception is a broad field that takes in ideas from psychology and philosophy.
- For data visualisation we can perceive:
  - Length/Area/Volume,
  - Shape,
  - Position,
  - Color,
  - Angle.
--

- Now some examples where things go wrong.

---

# Confusing length and area

![mac](img/mac.jpg)

---

# Confusing Length and Area 

- On the previous plot, the number of customers is mapped to length (height of computer)
--

- The area of the 2D pictures of computers scale up more than their heights.
--

- The picture leads us to imagine a 3D computer making this effect worse.
--

- The value for Mac is only about 3 to 4 times more than for None but we perceive the difference to be much more.

---

# Beware 3D

]


---

# Beware 3D

- Difficult to line up heights of bars with actual values
--

- Closer green bar (MSN) looks bigger.
  - Do not use 3 dimensions when 2 work well.
--

- On the pie chart the green segment looks bigger.
--

- In general angles are difficult to perceive 
  - Experts in visualisation prefer not to use pie charts, but they are popular in practice.
--

- Argumentum ad populum / Three men make a tiger.

---

# Lie factor

![](img/Lie_factor_example1_image.jpg)

---

# Lie factor

- The data indicates that mileage rose from 18 to 27.5 which is a 53% increase.
--

- The line on the graph increases from 0.6 inches to 5.3 inches which is a 783% increase!
--

- Tufte formalises this into a lie factor of 783/53≈14.
--

- It should be 1!
--

- Note that in contrast to previous examples where it was difficult to *decode* insights from the visualisation, here there is an error in how the data are *encoded* into a visualisation.

---

# Wrong data or plot

.pull-left[
![](img/display.jpeg)
]
.pull-right[
![](img/Its-a-pizza-Chart-Not-a-Pie-chart-1.png)
]

---

# Issues

- The percentages do not add up to 100.
- In the plot on the left, the data are a time series
- In the plot on the right, respondents can like more than one topic
- In both cases the pie chart is a poor choice of visualisation for the data at hand.
--

- Also pineapple should never be on a pizza!

---

# Bad (but not wrong) data

![](img/diminishing-return.jpg)

---

# Problems

- There is nothing incorrect about this graph.
- However the message is misleading.
- The income is a yearly income while the cost of college is over four years (and only paid once).
- Also it does not show the income of people who are not college graduates.
- Think carefully about comparisons on a plot.
- Make sure conclusions align with what is in the plot.

# Storytelling with data

---

# Data storytelling

- Data storytelling is not about generating pretty charts and data presentations. 
- It is about communicating insights that deliver real value.
- Good data stories have data, visualisations and narrative

---

# Guide to building narrative

Following discussion based on some Harvard Business Review articles
--

- How to make sure you're not using data just to justify decisions you've already made [ (link)](https://hbr.org/2018/10/how-to-make-sure-youre-not-using-data-just-to-justify-decisions-youve-already-made)
- Use data to answer you key business questions[(link)](https://hbr.org/2020/02/use-data-to-answer-your-key-business-questions)

# Key Business Questions

- What problem am I trying to solve?
  - Focus on something *actionable*!
- Immerse yourself in data
  - Including visualisation
- Generate KBQs
  - Make purpose specific
- Prioritise KBQs
  - Focus on easily activated, high impact KBQs
- Iterate!

---

# Example: Tesla

- Purpose: Improve customer satisfaction and operations with tyres?
--
- Visualisation:
![](img/tesla.png)

---

# Tesla: KBQs

- Identify KBQs
  - Is there sufficient quality control on tyres leaving factory?
  - How long do customers take to respond to a low pressure alert?
  - Can we predict when when tyres go flat?
--

- Prioritise KBQs
  - Will depend on context
  - Predictive model may not be easily activated.
  
---

# Narrative

- All stories consist of 
--

 - Setup (current reality)
 - Conflict (change)
 - Resolution (new reality)
--

- For an example (with house prices) see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5_34YnCmMY&t=13s).
